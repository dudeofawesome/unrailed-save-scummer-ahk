Unrailed deletes saves immediately after loading them, so this program backs
them up and replaces them upon deletion.

Executables in [releases tab](https://github.com/dudeofawesome/unrailed-save-scummer/releases)

## How to use

1. Run `unrailed-save-scummer.exe`
1. Make a save. You should then see a `backups` folder appear
1. Load your save. After a second, you should see the deleted save file get replaced
